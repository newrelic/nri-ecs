# New Relic integration for Amazon ECS

This integration collects metrics from ECS clusters and containers in AWS.

By itself, this integration just collects metadata of the ECS cluster, that is used to decorate all the metrics collected by the [nri-docker][1] integration , the Infrastructure Agent and the on host integrations that has been activated.

This repo generates the [newrelic/nri-ecs][5] image which is based on the [infrastructure-bundle][3] that contains the Agent and the others on host integrations.

## Requirements

- Go 1.19
- ECS agent version 1.21 or greater.

## Installation

Create a task definition that runs [newrelic/nri-ecs][5] in your ECS cluster. In our [docs][2] you can find information on how to
set up your infrastructure automatically with CloudFormation, or generating the task definition via command line or manually.

## Building

To generate the integration image execute:

```
$ make image NRI_ECS_IMAGE_REPO=myrepo/nri-ecs
```

This will generate the integration docker image for Linux amd64.

# Development

A debug mode is provided to aid in development. It runs a special container that simulates the metadata endpoints of the AWS ECS agent.

To build this container and get a shell into, run `make debug-mode`.

# Testing

To execute unit tests, run this command:

```
$ make test
```

You can run a specific test by invoking go (which is also how you can run tests on Windows):

```
$ go test -race -run ''      # Run all tests.
$ go test -race -run Foo     # Run top-level tests matching "Foo", such as "TestFooBar".
$ go test -race -run Foo/A=  # For top-level tests matching "Foo", run subtests matching "A=".
$ go test -race -run /A=1    # For all top-level tests, run subtests matching "A=1".
```

For more information, see [Testing][4] in the official Go docs.
